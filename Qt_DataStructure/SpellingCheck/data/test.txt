An individual human existance should be like a river
small at first, narrowly contained within its bannks.
and rushing passionately past boulders and over waterfalls.
Gradually the river grw wider, the banks recede.
the water flow more quitely, and in the end,
withut any visible break, they becomed merged in the ssea.
na painlessly lose theur individua being.
